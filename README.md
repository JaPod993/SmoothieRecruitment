# Smoothie Delight

Smoothie Delight is a simple one page project for recruitment purposes

## Live version

https://japod993.github.io/SmoothieRecruitment/

## Built With

* [Bootstrap Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/) - I chose a ready grid system to quickly implement the code
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) - compass for scss compilation
* [WorkBox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) - Fast PWA & static files cache implementation

## Implementation ideas

### Design
* I would like to add some interface animations

### SEO

### What i did:
* I made sure that this page is written semantically correct.
* I've added all necessary meta tags.
* I've made sure that page load is fast enough. (compressed images, static files cache)
* 
### What else to do:
* Implement lazyloading using intersection observer (even faster page load)
* Use "picture" tag for more responsive images
* Add sitemap.xml
* Use schema.org meta data (e.g. contact info & all smoothie products )



### Accessibility

### What i did:
* I've used Lighthouse audit to make sure my site is accessibility friendly.
* All interface elements are visible and focusable.
* All links, buttons, forms and images have visible names, titles and alt attributes.

### What else to do:
* We could add ARIA labels like role="" 
* We could use tabindex="" to change importance of focusable elements
